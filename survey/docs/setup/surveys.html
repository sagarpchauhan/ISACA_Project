			<h1>Creating Surveys</h1>
      <p class="text1">Creating surveys is a very easy process. This page details a few of the options and features of the survey system. Please read carefully. Thank you!</p>

      <h1>Creating Your First Survey</h1>
      <p class="text1">Firstly, click on 'Surveys' in the admin area and select the link in right hand menu 'Create New Survey'. You`ll be presented with a list of form options. Lets

      </p>

      <h1>Questions</h1>
      <p class="text1">Once you have added a new survey, you need to add some questions to that survey. You can add as many questions as you like, unless you are
      limited to the free version. Note that you cannot view a survey until you have added some questions.<br /><br />
      To add questions, select 'Surveys' from the admin menu. You`ll be presented with a screen similar to the following:<br /><br />
      <img class="imgPad" src="img/caps/cap1.jpg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />

      Click the 'Show Link' button to view the url for your survey. The four buttons to the right of each survey are as follows:<br /><br />
      <span style="display:block;background:url('img/preview.gif') no-repeat left center;padding-left:25px;font-weight:bold;height:20px">Preview Survey</span>
      <span style="display:block;background:url('img/edit.gif') no-repeat left center;padding-left:25px;font-weight:bold;height:20px">Edit Survey</span>
      <span style="display:block;background:url('img/options.gif') no-repeat left center;padding-left:25px;font-weight:bold;height:20px">Survey Options</span>
      <span style="display:block;background:url('img/delete.gif') no-repeat left center;padding-left:25px;font-weight:bold;height:20px">Delete Survey</span><br />

      Preview, edit &amp; delete should be self explanatory. For your questions, click the survey options link. You will see a list of options in the right hand menu.
      Click 'Add/Remove Questions' and then on the next page, select 'Add New Question'.<br /><br />

      The questions page should be fairly straightforward. Include some help text if you want to help visitors understand a question, and select the question type
      that would require. Use the 'Examples' link provided on the page for more help and to see form examples. Multiple options are only applicable for certain
      form types. When you are happy with your entries, click 'Add New Question'.


      </p>

      <h1>Ordering/Editing &amp; Deleting Questions</h1>
      <p class="text1">To edit or delete a question, refer to the previous paragraph and select 'Add/Remove Questions'. You can also choose which order you want to
      display the questions by using the drop down menus on the same page. After each select the page will refresh with the new order. See the following diagram:<br /><br />
      <img class="imgPad" src="img/caps/cap2.jpg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>Copying Survey/Viewing &amp; Clearing Results</h1>
      <p class="text1">Going back to the previously mentioned options screen, in the right hand menu you`ll see the following:<br /><br />
      <img class="imgPad" src="img/caps/cap3.jpg" alt="" title="" /><br /><br />

      A really useful feature of Maian Survey is the ability to copy a survey. You might have 2 surveys very similar and want to copy the data. Use the copy option
      for this. Note that no 2 surveys can have the same title. The clear option will clear all results from a survey and you can click 'View Results' to view the current
      results. Note that the results page is always viewable to admin, even if public view is switched off.
      </p>

      <h1>Exporting Contacts</h1>
      <p class="text1">
      The options screen also has the ability to 'Export Contacts. This lets you export your names &amp; e-mail addresses that have been left by visitors into a .CSV file. This
      can be useful if you want to import the data into another program. Note that some visitors may not have left their correct and valid details and you should always be aware
      of this. Requesting users details doesn`t go down well with some people.

      </p>

      <h1>Keyword Analysis</h1>
      <p class="text1">
      And finally on the options screen is ability to view a 'Keyword Analysis'. This will only be applicable if you enabled keyword logging for a survey. The keyword option
      lets you see a list of keywords used for a survey. You can filter the keywords by question or date or both and you can print all keywords. You can also click a keyword to
      view all answers associated with that keyword. The keyword analysis page also shows the frequency of each keyword and the percentage. Use the 'Clear Keywords' option to remove
      keywords.
      </p>

      <h1>Viewing Survey</h1>
      <p class="text1">
      Remember, you can only view a survey after you have added some questions. The web link for any survey will be:<br /><br />
      <b>http://www.yoursite.com/survey/index.php?survey=xxxxxx</b><br /><br />
      where <b>xxxxxx</b> is the unique 6-digit code generated by the system. Click "Show Link" option in the admin area if you aren`t sure.
      </p>

      <h1>Help/Support</h1>
      <p class="text1">
      As this software is a little out of date and so that I can focus on new software, Maian Survey is no longer supported. Sorry.
